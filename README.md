Here is my forecast: 

* Democrats win the house, gaining 47 seats, and the senate, for a total of 53 seats.

Voter turnout is at a record high, and the record shows the greater voter turnout is, the more likely Democrats are likely to win. The first two years of the Trump presidency have mobilized the Democratic vote in protest, and even moderate Republicans have been alienated by the rhetoric of the administration.
